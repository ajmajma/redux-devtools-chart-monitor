# redux-store-visualizer

Visualize Redux store in real time with [d3-state-visualizer](https://github.com/romseguy/d3-state-visualizer)

# Quick demo

![Quick demo](demo.gif)

# Features

- Fully configurable
- Collapsible nodes
- Hot reloadable since it's only a component that receive any state as props
- Redux and React are not hard dependencies, I used my favorite tools for this demo but you can use your own stack

# Try it out yourself!

```
git clone https://github.com/romseguy/redux-store-visualizer.git
cd redux-store-visualizer
npm install
npm start
# http://localhost:3000
```

Also, the implementation in your own project is really straightforward. Take a look at this [commit](https://github.com/romseguy/redux-store-visualizer/commit/725ee1f4d2b13b73c7ed40a485bc73e7820ba3a4).
